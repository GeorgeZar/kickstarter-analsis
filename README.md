# kickstarter-analsis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on my work, I can say that the Parent Category Outcomes sheet and method came out as more direct and easier to read for someone that needs a quick answer. The graphs helps for someone more visual as well which is important. The Subcategory is more detailed so for someone that might needs more information and for future plans without being in a hurry to take a decision on to where to invest for example.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After filtering the given information, I can conclude that the top 3 investments should go towards Theater, Music and Film & Video and avoid things such as journalisme, technology and food!

What are some limitations of this dataset?
I would say we dont know which type of Theater, Music and Film & Video genre brings in the most clientale. As they are vary vaste, we could increase sales on the genre of every type if few knew which genre brings the most money to each film video, theater and music as well!

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Within the top 3 most succesfull data we pulled, we can go even deeper and see which genre brings in the most money to our investements and how we can improve our work as well in the other genres that are struggling.
